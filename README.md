This is a game meant to simulate a Hang Man game. The theme for the game is Medieval Fantasy. Go forth, heroes!

The game will ask you to press a key to start the game.

After that, you have a limited number of letter guesses to figure out what the word is (remember, it's medieval-themed). If you guess the word in the alloted number of letter guesses, you get a win!

The game will repeat itself, choosing a new random word for you to guess.
